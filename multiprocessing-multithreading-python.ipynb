    "# Multiprocessing and Multithreading in Python: A Comparative Study\n",
    "**Multiprocessing** and **Multithreading** are both mechanisms to achieve concurrency & parallelism in execution of programs and utilization of system resources. However, depending on the specific requiremets of the application, there are some differences in the way they achieve this which should be kept in mind while making a choice.\n",
    "1. Multiprocessing:\n",
    "    - Multiprocessing involves creating multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "    - Processes run independently and can execute in parallel on different CPU cores.\n",
    "    - Processes communicate through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory.\n",
    "    - Each process has its own Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), allowing for true parallel execution and utilization of multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "    - Multiprocessing is suitable for CPU-bound tasks that can benefit from parallel execution, as well as for achieving better resource isolation and handling crashes or exceptions in separate processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multithreading:\n",
    "    - Multithreading involves creating multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space and resources.\n",
    "    - Threads run concurrently, but due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
    "    - Multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks or situations where the blocking of one thread does not significantly impact the overall performance.\n",
    "    - Threads can communicate and coordinate by sharing data through shared memory, but proper synchronization mechanisms (such as locks or semaphores) are required to avoid data races and ensure thread safety.\n",
    "    - Although multithreading may not fully utilize multiple CPU cores for CPU-bound tasks, it can still provide benefits in scenarios where parallel execution is not the primary concern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In python commonly used module for Multiprocessing is **multiprocessing** and **threading** for multithreading. Let's try out some use cases with them.  \n"
